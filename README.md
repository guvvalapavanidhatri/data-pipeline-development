*PROJECT DESCRIPTION*

This repository showcases the design and implementation of a scalable and modular data pipeline that automates the end-to-end process of ingesting, transforming, and storing data for analytics and reporting.This project implements a robust data pipeline designed to collect, process, and store data efficiently from source to destination. It demonstrates end-to-end data engineering workflows using modern tools and best practices.

In modern data-driven applications, raw data must go through multiple stages before it's ready for analysis. This project addresses that need by building a robust data pipeline that:

Connects to raw data sources (e.g., APIs, databases, file systems)

Applies transformation logic (e.g., cleaning, normalization, enrichment)

Loads the final data into a destination system for storage and consumption (e.g., data warehouse or cloud storage)

Monitors and logs the process for performance, errors, and transparency

Use Cases:

ETL/ELT pipelines for business intelligence and analytics

Automated data refresh for dashboards (e.g., Tableau, Power BI)

Building a foundation for machine learning pipelines

Real-time alerting systems based on data changes
